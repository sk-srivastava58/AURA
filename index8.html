        <p class="article7"> NASA's Parker Solar Probe is diving into the Sun’s atmosphere, facing brutal heat and radiation, on a mission
             to give humanity its first-ever sampling of a star’s atmosphere.
            On Dec. 14, 2021, NASA announced that Parker had flown through the Sun’s upper atmosphere – the corona – and sampled particles
             and magnetic fields there. This marked the first time in history, a spacecraft had touched the Sun.
            Parker Solar Probe is designed to swoop within about 4 million miles (6.5 million kilometers) of the Sun's surface to trace the
             flow of energy, to study the heating of the solar corona, and to explore what accelerates the solar wind.
            During its journey, the mission will provide answers to long-standing questions that have puzzled scientists for more than 60 years: 
            Why is the corona much hotter than the Sun's surface (the photosphere)? 
            How does the solar wind accelerate?
             What are the sources of high-energy solar particles?
            We live in the Sun's atmosphere and this mission will help scientists better understand the Sun's impact on Earth. Data from Parker 
            will be key to understanding and, perhaps, forecasting space weather. 
            Parker can survive the Sun's harsh conditions because cutting-edge thermal engineering advances protect the spacecraft during its dangerous 
            journey. The probe has four instrument suites designed to study magnetic fields, plasma, and energetic particles, and image the solar wind.
            The mission is named for   Dr. Eugene N. Parker, who pioneered our modern understanding of the Sun.

         <p class="article13">   Integrated Science Investigation of the Sun or IS☉IS, is an instrument aboard the
              Parker Solar Probe, a space probe designed to study the Sun. IS☉IS is focused on measuring energetic
               particles from the Sun, including electrons, protons, and ions. The parent spacecraft was launched in
                early August 2018, and with multiple flybys of Venus will study the heliosphere of the Sun from less
                 that 4 million kilometers or less than 9 solar radii.
             IS☉IS consists of two detectors, EPI-Lo and EPI-Hi, corresponding to detection of relatively lower and 
             higher energy particles. EPI-Lo is designed to detect from about 20 keV per nucleon up to 15 MeV 
             (mega electronvolts) total energy, and for electrons from about 25 keV up to 1000 keV. EPI-Hi is 
             designed to measure charged particles from about 1– to 200 MeV per nucleon and electrons from about
              0.5 to 6 MeV, according to a paper about the device.
             The shortname includes a symbol for the Sun, a circle with a dot in it: ☉. NASA suggests pronouncing
              the name as "ee-sis" in English.

                 by the U.S. Naval Research Laboratory. The Parker Solar Probe with WISPR on board was launched by
                  a Delta IV Heavy on 12 August 2018 from Cape Canaveral, Florida. WISPR is intended take advantage
                   of the spacecraft's proximity to the Sun by taking coronagraph-style images of the solar corona
                    and features like coronal streamers, plumes, and mass ejections. One of the goals is to better
                     understand the structure of the solar corona near the Sun.
                 WISPR is designed to study the electron density and velocity structure of the corona. The instrument
                  field of view is planned to extend from 13 to 108 degrees away from the Sun, and does not directly 
                  image the Sun; the area of interest is a very wide field extending away from the Sun.
                 WISPR includes two separate telescopes, each with a radiation-hardened CMOS imager with resolution of
                  2,048×1,920 pixels. The CMOS sensors are an active pixel sensor type of detector.
                 The WISPR first light image was published in September 2018. In December, a view of the corona including
                  a coronal streamer was released.

                                    hydrogen. What happens is that the hydrogen nuclei collide into one another and form helium nuclei.
                                     This process of transformation from hydrogen to helium is called the proton-proton chain. In order

                                                 times larger than Earth's, the overall influence of the Sun's magnetic field is vast.
                                              The magnetic field of the Sun actually extends far out into space, beyond the furthest planet
                                               (Pluto). This distant extension of the Sun's magnetic field is called the Interplanetary 
                                               Magnetic Field (IMF). The solar wind, the stream of charged particles that flows outward
                                                from the Sun, carries the IMF to the planets and beyond. The solar wind and IMF interact
                                                 with planetary magnetic fields in complex ways, generating phenomena such as the aurora.
                                              Overall, the basic shape of the Sun's magnetic field is like the shape of Earth's field... or
                                               like the field of a simple bar magnet. However, superimposed on this basic field
                                                (called a dipole field) is a much more complex series of local fields that vary over time.
                                                 Places where the Sun's magnetic field is especially strong are called active regions, and 
                                                 often produce telltale sunspots.

                                   <p class="article29"> On May 31, 2017, NASA has renamed the Solar Probe Plus spacecraft humanity's first
                                       mission to a star, which will launch in 2018 as the "Parker Solar Probe" in honor of astrophysicist
                                        Eugene Parker. The announcement was made at a ceremony at the University of Chicago, where Parker
                                         serves as the S. Chandrasekhar Distinguished Service Professor Emeritus, Department of Astronomy
                                          and Astrophysics.
                                      The SPP science objectives are: 3) 4) 5)
                                      1) Determine the structure and dynamics of the magnetic fields at the sources of the fast and 
                                      slow solar wind.
                                      2) Trace the flow of energy that heats the corona and accelerates the solar wind.
                                      3) Determine what mechanisms accelerate and transport energetic particles.
                                      4) Explore dusty plasma phenomena in the near-sun environment and their influence on the solar
                                       wind and energetic particle formation.
                                      
                                      Parker Solar Probe has officially sampled the sun
                                      In December 2021, NASA announced that Parker Solar Probe had achieved its
                                       cornerstone objective: making the first measurements from within the atmosphere of a star,
                                        effectively becoming the first spacecraft to "touch the sun." On Aug. 9, Parker was roughly 6.5
                                         million miles (10.4 million km) away from the sun's surface and hit a top speed of about 330,000 mph (532,000 kph)

                              The Sun’s corona is the outermost part of the Sun’s atmosphere. 
                              The corona is usually hidden by the bright light of the Sun's surface.
                               That makes it difficult to see without using special instruments.
                                However, the corona can be viewed during a total solar eclipse.
